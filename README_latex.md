## Mandelbrot Trajectory Infima

These renders below are the result of considering the "trajectories" of points inside the mandelbrot
set when iterating $z \mapsto z^2 + c$. Specifically, looking at the closest point on such a
trajectory to the origin $a(c) = \inf \{\left|z_n\right|\} = \inf \{\left|P_c^n(0)\right|\}$. As far
as I can tell, this was first described / explored in a 1986 book "The Beauty of Fractals".
